For many high school seniors, going to the right college is the most crucial decision to make. The journey of gaining knowledge and a degree in a field of their interest is not the only worry. A student must seek out an institution that they will feel comfortable going to and will feel like an outsider. A college/university name or prestige cannot be the only factor a student should look at while making this decision. Students will like to look at other factors such as average standardized test scores, student body size, and diversity. 
In this report, Group 7 will focus on the factors that students should be looking into when they perfect choice and their chances of getting admitted to their top picks. The team members will analyze the "College Admissions" dataset obtained from Kaggle revolving around college admissions/class demographics according to various universities across the 50 states.
